Recommended actions: Copy the StatsSystem folder to your Assets folder (merge in existing folders if necessary).
Note that the paths Assets/Stats/StatsData Assets/Stats/ModifiersData are set up to be the default for the editor utility to work,
you can change it in the script in the Editor folder if this path does not suit your preferred project structure.
